            Birthday: Feb 21<br />
            Age: 16 <br />
            Gender: Female <br />Blood Type: O <br /><br /><br />Gotou Hitori is
            a shy, gloomy high-schooler who started learning guitar after seeing
            rock bands on TV, in the hope that she too could become as popular
            as them. However, after 2 years she has yet to make a single friend
            or join a band. She instead sits in her closet at home, recording
            guitar covers and posting them to her YouTube channel, "guitarhero",
            on which she has amassed a reasonable following.
